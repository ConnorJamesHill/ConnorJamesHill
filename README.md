# Connor Hill  
### iOS Developer • Systems Thinker • Architecture-Focused Builder

I build production-level iOS applications with a strong emphasis on clean architecture, scalability, and long-term maintainability.

My focus is building real products — not demo apps.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

I treat applications as systems — not collections of screens.

My priorities:
- Separation of concerns
- Testability
- Predictable state management
- Clear data flow
- Long-term maintainability

I design for scale — both technically and structurally.
